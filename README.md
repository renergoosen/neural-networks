# Neural Networks with PyTorch

This repository contains a collection of my work using **PyTorch** to build and train neural networks for a range of classification tasks. These projects allowed me to develop a strong understanding of deep learning principles and how to apply them to real-world and artificial datasets.

## üóÇÔ∏è Contents

### 1. Brain Tumour Classification
- **Project**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images into different tumour categories.
- **Tools**: PyTorch, torchvision, PIL, NumPy
- **Overview**: This was my first deep learning project, where I implemented a CNN from scratch using PyTorch. I explored architecture design, loss functions, optimisers, and overfitting controls (dropout, data augmentation).
- **Highlights**:
  - Image pre-processing and augmentation
  - CNN architecture design and tuning
  - Accuracy and loss tracking across epochs

### 2. Iris Species Classifier
- **Project**: Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on the Iris dataset.
- **Tools**: PyTorch, pandas, scikit-learn
- **Overview**: I built and trained a simple fully connected neural network to classify Iris flowers based on sepal/petal features. This project helped solidify my understanding of backpropagation and hyperparameter tuning.

### 3. Wildfire Risk Classifier
- **Project**: Ongoing research-oriented project to classify wildfire risk using artificial and real-world data.
- **Tools**: PyTorch, NumPy, matplotlib, synthetic data generation tools
- **Overview**: This project extends my earlier neural network work to a research application. I created artificial data representing factors like vegetation, slope, and temperature, and built a model to classify wildfire risk levels. I also experimented with generating synthetic vegetation imagery for future CNN-based risk mapping.
- **Research Context**: This work began during a summer internship and continued alongside my university studies in collaboration with a research team. The aim is to apply machine learning to real-world risk mapping challenges.
- **In Progress**: I plan to extend the model using real satellite and environmental data over the summer.
